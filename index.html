        <h1>Privacy Policy for SSC RAILWAY Answer Key Marks Calculator Chrome Extension</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 21, 2024</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the "SSC RAILWAY Answer Key Marks Calculator" Chrome Extension (the "Extension"), developed by RAMANUJAN, handles your information when you use the Extension.</p>

        <h2>Information We Handle</h2>
        <p>The Extension is designed to enhance your experience with DigiAlm-based answer key pages. To provide its functionality, the Extension handles the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>User-Configured Settings:</strong>
                The Extension uses Chrome's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) and synchronized storage (`chrome.storage.sync`) to save your preferences. This includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Your chosen marking schemes (marks for correct answers, marks deducted for wrong answers, and selected exam presets).</li>
                    <li>Your preferences for how automatically detected answer key links should be handled (e.g., ask to open, list in popup, notify only).</li>
                </ul>
                These settings are stored locally in your browser or, if you have Chrome Sync enabled, may be synced across your devices via your Google account. The Extension itself does not have direct access to your Google account or other personally identifiable information linked to it beyond what is facilitated by `chrome.storage.sync`.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Website Content (Processed Locally):</strong>
                When you activate the Extension on a DigiAlm answer key page (`*.digialm.com/*`), the Extension's content scripts read and process the HTML content of that page. This includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Question details (text, ID).</li>
                    <li>Your chosen options for each question.</li>
                    <li>The officially correct options.</li>
                    <li>Exam-related information displayed on the page (e.g., Roll Number, Candidate Name, Subject, Exam Date/Time) for display within the Extension's result panel.</li>
                    <li>Embedded answer key (SCORM/HTML) links.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>This information is processed entirely within your local browser. It is NOT collected, stored on any external server, or transmitted to the developer or any third party by the Extension.</strong> Its sole purpose is to calculate your marks and display the detailed result analysis directly on the page for your convenience.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide Extension Functionality:</strong> The handled information is used exclusively to enable the core features of the Extension, such as calculating marks, displaying your performance analysis, and managing answer key links.</li>
            <li><strong>To Personalize Your Experience:</strong> Stored settings allow the Extension to remember your preferences for future use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>The "SSC RAILWAY Answer Key Marks Calculator" Extension <strong>does not share any of your personal information or the data it processes from DigiAlm pages with any third parties.</strong> All processing and storage of settings (other than Chrome's own sync mechanism for `chrome.storage.sync`) occur locally within your browser environment.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>User-configured settings stored via `chrome.storage.local` are kept within your browser's local storage. Settings stored via `chrome.storage.sync` are handled by Google Chrome's synchronization mechanisms. The Extension relies on the security measures provided by your browser and Google Chrome for this data.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
