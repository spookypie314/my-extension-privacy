        <h1>Privacy Policy for SSC RAILWAY Answer Key Marks Calculator</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 21, 2025 <!-- <<< REPLACE WITH THE ACTUAL CURRENT DATE WHEN YOU PUBLISH THIS -->
        </p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how "SSC RAILWAY Answer Key Marks Calculator" (the "Extension"), developed by RAMANUJAN, handles your information when you use the Extension. Your privacy is important to us.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Process</h2>
        <p>The Extension is designed to operate entirely locally within your Chrome browser. We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal information on any remote servers controlled by RAMANUJAN or any third party.</p>
        <p>The types of data the Extension interacts with are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>DigiAlm Website Content:</strong> When you navigate to and use the Extension on a *.digialm.com answer key page or a portal page containing links to such keys, the Extension reads the content of that specific page. This content may include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Question text, images, and associated data.</li>
                    <li>Multiple choice options.</li>
                    <li>Your selected answers (if visible on the page).</li>
                    <li>The officially correct answers.</li>
                    <li>URLs embedded within the page that may link to answer keys.</li>
                </ul>
                This information is accessed solely for the purpose of providing the Extension's core functionality as described in Section 2. This data is processed **locally within your browser** and is **never transmitted off your device by the Extension.**
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User Preferences (Local Browser Storage):</strong> The Extension uses your browser's local storage capabilities (`chrome.storage.local` and `chrome.storage.sync`) to save your settings. This includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Your selected exam presets.</li>
                    <li>Custom marking schemes (marks for correct and incorrect answers).
                    </li>
                    <li>Extension behavior preferences (e.g., SCORM link handling options).</li>
                </ul>
                This data is stored locally in your browser to enhance your user experience by remembering your preferences for future use. This data is **not accessible to RAMANUJAN or any third party** and is not transmitted from your device.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information processed by the Extension is used exclusively to provide its stated features and core functionality, all of which occur locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Calculate Marks:</strong> The primary use of DigiAlm page content is to calculate your marks based on the answer key data and the marking scheme you provide or select.</li>
            <li><strong>To Display Performance Analysis:</strong> Results, including section-wise scores, correct/wrong counts, bonus question details, and performance mini-charts, are generated and displayed directly within an overlay on the DigiAlm page.</li>
            <li><strong>To Enable Question Filtering:</strong> To allow you to filter the displayed questions by text or status (Correct, Incorrect, Unanswered, Bonus) for focused review.</li>
            <li><strong>To Detect and Manage Answer Key Links:</strong> To find and present direct links to DigiAlm answer keys from portal pages, and allow you to open or copy these links.</li>
            <li><strong>To Save Your Preferences:</strong> To remember your settings for marking schemes and options for your convenience across sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>To Provide Notifications:</strong> To optionally inform you about detected answer key links or any issues encountered while processing an answer key page.</li>
            <li><strong>To Enable Clipboard Functionality:</strong> To allow you to copy answer key links or result summaries to your clipboard.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>RAMANUJAN **does not share or disclose any data** accessed or processed by the Extension (including DigiAlm page content or your local settings) with any third parties. As all processing is local and no data is transmitted to external servers by the Extension, there is no data held by RAMANUJAN to share.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All data processed by the Extension (DigiAlm page content) is handled transiently for calculation and display and is not persistently stored by the Extension, except for user preferences which are stored locally in your browser's `chrome.storage` facility. The security of this locally stored data is dependent on the security of your own computer and Chrome browser environment.</p>
        <p>The Extension does not employ its own encryption for data processed locally, as it relies on the inherent security mechanisms of the Chrome browser and the user's operating system.</p>

        <h2>5. Permissions Used by the Extension</h2>
        <p>The Extension requests the minimum permissions necessary to provide its features. These are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><code>storage</code>:</strong> Essential for saving your marking scheme preferences and extension options locally in your browser, allowing for a personalized and consistent user experience.</li>
            <li><strong><code>notifications</code>:</strong> Used to provide optional, helpful alerts to you regarding detected answer key links or issues encountered while processing an answer key, aiding in the use of the Extension.</li>
            <li><strong><code>clipboardWrite</code>:</strong> Enables you to easily copy detected answer key links or summaries of your calculated results to your system clipboard for your own use.</li>
            <li><strong><code>tabs</code>:</strong> Necessary for the Extension to open DigiAlm answer key links in new browser tabs when you request it, and to facilitate communication between the Extension's popup interface and the content scripts running on the active DigiAlm page to perform the analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Host Permission for <code>*://*.digialm.com/*</code>:</strong> This is fundamental to the Extension's core purpose. It allows the Extension to access and read the content of DigiAlm answer key pages and portal pages that you choose to visit. This access is strictly limited to the digialm.com domain and is required to extract the necessary data for mark calculation and result analysis, which are then displayed locally on the page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. User Control and Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>Since the Extension does not store your DigiAlm answer key data or analysis results on any remote server, there is no server-side data to delete. User preferences stored locally via `chrome.storage` can be cleared by:
            <ul>
                <li>Uninstalling the Extension, which will remove its associated local storage.</li>
                <li>Manually clearing browsing data within Chrome, including "Cookies and other site data" or "Hosted app data" which may include extension storage.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Extension is not directed at children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension's Chrome Web Store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
